Building an AI-Powered Game
an AI-powered Interactive Role-Playing Game (RPG) using advanced AI models and Gradio for a user-friendly interface. This project combines storytelling, dynamic world-building, and real-time interaction to create a unique gaming experience. ðŸŽ®âœ¨

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:

The game uses AI as a Game Master, dynamically generating narratives and responses based on player actions.
A fully customizable JSON-based world with kingdoms, towns, and NPCs brings creativity to life.
Built with Gradio for an intuitive and interactive text-based gameplay experience.
ðŸš€ How it Works:

Players explore the world, make decisions, and interact with characters using a chatbot-like interface.
The AI generates backstories, settings, and responses in real-time, ensuring every playthrough is unique.
The game leverages the meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf model via the Together API to create immersive, second-person storytelling.
This project not only demonstrates the power of AI in creative applications but also showcases my skills in AI model integration, interactive UI development, and dynamic content generation.
